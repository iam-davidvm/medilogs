<p>I recently followed a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">web development course</a> and this is my first big project outside the course.</p>
<p>The goal of this website is to be a medical journal, where a user keeps track of his blood pressure, medication scheme... At this moment the focus is tracking your blood pressure. I want to take time to learn some lessongs vrom it, before expanding.</p>

## What I have learned

It was a big first project after following the online course, so it was quite a challenge. I had to get through topics which I didn't learn in the course yet. Additionally the topics that were covered were little chunks, while I needed to think bigger. And I decided to work with the newer mongodb and nodejs versions, which had some important changes.

- Setting up an Ubuntu server on a VPS

- Using a mail (Sendgrid) API to activate an account and to let a user reset his password

- Working with a chart framework

- I decided not to use any front-end framework. The reason is I want to get my basic skills as good as possible. But I noticed I like the back-end more then the front-end.

## Things I may change in the future

I re-designed the website like 3 times. I think there are still classes declared in the different element which aren't used anymore. I should clean this up.

At this moment the website is live and I try to lure some people to it. I am going to leave it unchanged for a while expect for some bugs which might be discovered. In a half year or a year I want to add one extra feature from this list:

- Keep an inventory of medication in stock. Name, description, amount, expiry date

- Keep a scheme of the daily dose of medication a person has to take

- Make notes if you're ill

## Conclusion

> I am proud of the result, because I see myself as a junior developer.
